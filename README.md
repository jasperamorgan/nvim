# My Neovim Configs

This setup of neovim was bootstrapped from the series of articles by [Chris@Machine](https://www.chrisatmachine.com/). Also check out his excellent neovim [YouTube series](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLhoH5vyxr6QqPtKMp03pcJd_Vg8FZ0rtg).

The config uses the following plugins:

* vim-polyglot - language syntax highlighting
* auto-pairs - provides closing of characters like (, {, " etc. (Could try TPope's vim-surround)
* dart-vim-plugin - vim support for dart programming & syntax highlighting
* coc - code completion
* coc-explorer - simple file explorer
* airline - status and tab bars
* vim-commentary - easily apply comments to code
* fzf - fuzzy finder plugin for nvim
